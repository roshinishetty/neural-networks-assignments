In assignment 1, I learnt to implement linear regression and logistic regression on datasets. I learnt to plot graphs appropriately, apply different types of gradient descent, various types of regressions, like L1, L2 and saw the variations using different types of methods. I learnt to apply K-means clustering when the output values for a dataset is not given to classify the data.  Logistic regression is applied for multiclass classification via, one vs one and  one vs all and compared the accuracies. I learnt different concepts in probabilistic approach like likelihood ratio test, maximum  a posteriori and maximum likelihood decision rules.
